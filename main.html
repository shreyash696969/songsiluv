            Shreyash (your personal non- nigga Sex Slave) says his love for you keeps growing stronger with every passing day. He loves you deeply and only wishes to see you smile. You know what? He really loves music, and every tune reminds him of you. You are the girl of his dreams, the one who makes his heart race. As long as you're by his side, nothing else matters. He can't take his eyes off yo, you're always on his mind. So, he created this special webpage, filled with songs that reflect how much you mean to him.</h2>
